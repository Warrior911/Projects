We present to you, a Convolutional Neural Network based Self-driving car, which we call CNNPicar. It is a small scale version of DAVE-2, a self-driving car by NVidia. In DAVE-2, NVidia used a forward-facing camera to capture images from different roads across different states in the US. Those images were then fed into a Convolutional Neural Network as input and the output of the Network was the steering angle that the car needs to turn to. In our CNNPicar, we used the same Network architecture that NVidia used in DAVE-2, which consists of 9 layers and a total of 252,219 parameters. We used a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (2GB) in our CNNPicar, which also uses a forward-facing camera to capture images from our custom built track and feeds it to the Convolutional Neural Network. By using our CNNPicar, we have demonstrated the computing capabilities of Raspberry Pi 4 for real-time control of Self-driving cars.
